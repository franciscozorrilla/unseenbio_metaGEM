# [metaGEM](https://github.com/franciscozorrilla/metaGEM/) workflow applied to samples from [unseen bio](https://unseenbio.com/)

### Objective
Showcase how the metaGEM workflow can be used to explore the human gut microbiome using whole metagenome shotgun sequencing data obtained from unseen bio's at-home test kits.

### Raw data
Unseenbio test kits were sent for sequencing on September 28 & October 21 2020, resulting in two 101 bp paired end reads sets with IDs S2772Nr1 and S2772Nr3. The paired end read sets have ~ 77 and 78 million reads respectively.
